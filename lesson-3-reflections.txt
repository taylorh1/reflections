When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So other people can see/add on to your work and you have a backup that
    does't rely on your hardware.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you let git do it automatically, you might end up with your local files
    being changed/damaged simply because the git file online was changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is simply a clone made on gitHub instead of locally. Forking makes
    it much easier to suggest changes back to the original project. A branch is
    simply a new part of the project within the original project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can better add commits and branches while offline and you can update
    only the local copy of remote branches (therefore not editing your local
    branch and still being able to see the changes that occurred on the remote)
